Amazon EC2 instance types

Amazon EC2 instance types(opens in a new tab) are optimized for different tasks. When selecting an instance type, consider the specific needs of your workloads and applications.
This might include requirements for compute, memory, or storage capabilities.

1.General purpose instances.

General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources. You can use them for a variety of workloads, such as:
* application servers
* gaming servers
* backend servers for enterprise applications
* small and medium databases
Suppose that you have an application in which the resource needs for compute, memory, and networking are roughly equivalent. You might consider running it on a general purpose instance because the application does not require optimization in any single resource area.


2.Compute optimized instances.

Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors. Like general purpose instances, you can use compute optimized instances for workloads such as web, application, and gaming servers.

However, the difference is compute optimized applications are ideal for high-performance web servers, compute-intensive applications servers, and dedicated gaming servers. You can also use compute optimized instances for batch processing workloads that require processing many transactions in a single group.

3.Memory optimized instances.
4.Accelerated computing instances.
5.Storage optimized instances.
